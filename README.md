Scans Fredericton, NB for pokemon using fastpokemap.se and stores the data in postgresql for analytics.

Reason for using fastpokemap.se is simply so that everyone in Fredericton can see the scan results.

NOTE: currently does not come with a map of any sorts. This is simply a backend tool at this time.
